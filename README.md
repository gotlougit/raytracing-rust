# Ray Tracing in One Weekend
## (with Rust)

This is me just following along to [Ray Tracing in One Weekend](https://raytracing.github.io/), an excellent resource to learn how computer graphics work with just software rendering, a simple PPM image format for exporting results, and a lot of math. Instead of doing the exercises in C++, I am trying to do them in Rust instead so that maybe I can leverage multithreading to speed up renders.
